# Solar-Charge-Controller-with-auto-load-disconnect-on-low-battery
Converted 12v output of the solar panel into 5 volts by LM2596 Buck Converter to feed the 5-volt battery; developed the program for ATmega328P Microcontroller to automatically connect/disconnect the battery with the solar panel by relay switch and BC 547 transistor after reading the voltage level of the battery by analog pin; used TIP 122 NPN transistor to connect/disconnect the load from the battery; displayed the solar and battery voltage and the charging condition in the liquid crystal display.<br/>
Tools: C/C++
