# Solar-Charge-Controller-with-auto-load-disconnect-on-low-battery
Converted 12V output of the solar panel into 5 volts by LM2596 Buck Converter to feed the 5-volt battery; developed the program for ATmega328P Microcontroller to automatically connect/disconnect the battery with the solar panel by relay switch and BC547 transistor after reading the voltage level of the battery by analog pin; used TIP 122 NPN transistor to connect/disconnect the load from the battery; displayed the solar and battery voltage and the charging condition in the liquid crystal display.</br>
Tools: Programming: C/C++, Hardware: 12V Solar Panel, LM2596 Buck Converter, Battery, Arduino UNO, BC547 Transistor, Relay Switch, TIP 122 Transistor, 20Ã—4 LCD Module, LED.</br>
